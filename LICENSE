The WMM predicts the difference between true north and magnetic north
around the world for the period 2005-2010. I believe that this is the
same model as used in most hand held GPS receivers.

I have ported the USGS WMM C code at http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/wmm_cdownload.shtml
to javascript.

You will find my javascript at

http://wheresthepath.googlepages.com/WorldMagneticModel.js

This code appears to give the same results as the BGS online
calculator at http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/gifs/wmm_calc.html.

Feel free to use for any purpose.
